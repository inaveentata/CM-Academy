# Career Matters Academy

Our Team is working with a commitment to help the Underprivileged Students.
This a One Stop Solution to get Job Notifications and University Admission
related information for the Higher Studies with Scholarships.

We share career opportunities and guide students to reach their
goals. We organize career guidance programmes for students in
schools, colleges, universities and in some remote villages too.

Lack of awareness about career options, many students from
underprivileged communities missing good opportunities.CM Academy
always tries to help those students who are from marginalized
sections.

Like Minded people can join our team to work towards our mission.
